a. The outcome space $s$ of this experiment is the the sum of top faces that recorded which are {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}

b. The sets that outcome will be 5 :
{(dice1 = 1, dice2 = 4),(dice1 = 4, dice2 = 1),(dice1 = 2, dice2 = 3),(dice1 = 3, dice2 = 2)}
$$P(5)= 4* \frac{1}{6*6}=\frac{1}{9}$$

(c) The sets that outcome will be divisible by 5 will be the sum that equal to 5 and 10. since we are only counting (5,5) once so the number of favorable outcome will be 7. 
P(outcome will be divisible by 5  ) = $$\frac{7}{36}$$
